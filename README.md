<h2>Ideal Job  </h2>

  The job :  Participate in large-scale digital project development for worldwide leading companieson various business domains. Participate in and may conduct code reviews. Follow, improve and enforce codingstandards.<br>

Skills needed :  1+ years of experience in web development technologies; have in-depth knowledge of PHP and OOP<br>

Developper Druppal Back end. It’s my passion because I love managing all server transmitions as well as client database. I’m passionate about data and computer programming in backend. 
The job consists in developing sites with the cms Drupal and Laravel. The advantage of cms is that the client can modify the content of the page himself. I know Drupal well but not Laravel. I know how to code in php and I have a good knowledge of CMS in general. I think that I will deepen my knowledge in Laravel to be the most versatile.   Making a website in its entirety with Laravel seems to me the easiest way to learn and understand how this CMS works.

<h1>DRUMS FACTORY </h1>


<h2>Overview : </h2>
<p>
 The DRUMS FACTORY project is the most ambitious project I’ve ever created. It is a sharing platform between drummer and battery enthusiast. An exchange forum, a learning platform, an e-commerce site to buy its drums, a live space to see live concerts on the Twitch platform. I want to create a universe with this site, a universe of exchange between enthusiasts, help for beginners and sharing for all.
</p>

<h2>Motivation : </h2>
<p>
 When I started drums, nobody helped me nor taught me the main tricks (what type of drumstick to choose, which drumstick is best for my budget, how to read a music score ). So I had to do my own research on the Internet to find out and it took me a long time. 
So I wanted to make a platform that brought the drummer community together around the world so that I could give each other advice, so that they could get video help on what he was looking for, to be able to choose the battery that best suits you. 
In short, a platform of sharing and passion.

<h2>Description : </h2>
<p>
Upon arrival on the website, the user will face the homepage which explains what the site offers as functionality as well as news and promotions. A complete site guide is available on this page with details of our motivations and principles.
A contact form in bah of the page using Jquery technology. It is next to a google map indicating the location of the store of the Drums Factory in Paris, the google map API is used. 
There is also an internal banner showing him the day’s promotions in the shop in the form of Slider Bootstrap.

</p>



<h2>Shop : </h2>
<p>
The store page offers offers on battery products or even whole batteries for beginners or experts. Batteries and products are offered by the site’s partner brands and all products are tested and tested directly in stores in Paris.
An article is written about each available product that describes its operation with an explanatory video, our review follows our tests as well as a price comparison according to reseller sites. 
The purchase does not happen directly on the site but on the reseller sites partner of the Drums Factory.


</p>



<h2>Tuto :  </h2>
<p>
The tutorial and learning part of our site is made according to the level of the person. Expert advice for beginners and professional advice for experts. 
A GUIDE TO THE LITTLE DRUMMER is provided and written by the moderator of the site with professionals for all the people who want to get started in the battery to know which battery to choose etc… 
A timeline in JS indicates the steps to follow for beginners at the beginning of the page followed by a video mosaic for tutorials that comes directly from our main partner DRUMEO who gives courses for all types of drummer. 
Check-out and professional users of the platform can also propose to post a video tutorial on the site.

</p>


<h2>Forum  </h2>
<p>
That’s the biggest part of the website.
A forum that allows the exchange between users and drummers. If you want to publish on the forum, you will have to create an account on the platform via the tab provided for this purpose. 
The forum will include a discussion space that will allow the drummer to exchange on topics their different points of view and a promotional space that will make it possible to find the best ideas on the internet or in store. 
A text chat will also be set up to communicate privately with other users. 
The forum will be managed by a team of moderators who will ensure the calm and tranquility of the users.

</p>

<h2>Live : </h2>
<p>
The Live part of the site is in partnership with Twitch and Pearllive. This allows different and professional people to do live lessons or just live Concerts retransmitted directly on the site. The Twitch API is used to have the best possible live quality. 
Users of the site can interact live with the live chat to ask questions or react to what is happening. 
Below the live screen there will be a dynamic calendar that will inform the user about the schedules of the different live. 
Live ads will pay the person who is live and a donation system is also in place so that people who watch live can donate to the person who is live.

</p>


<h2> Tools and Technologies : </h2>
<p>
I’m thinking of using a CMS such as Drupal 8 in Open Sources so that I can set up the site and be able to grant maintenance to someone who doesn’t know how to code. For the continuation the database will be made in Mongodb for ease of management. 
PHP Symfony will be recommended to do the chat or even the whole forum part
Javascript will be the right language for user interface management.
</p>


<h2> Outcome : </h2>
<p>
I will have teams that will maintain the site as well as a moderator team.
For development, a team consisting of a project manager and two developers (frontend and backend) will be able to ensure the proper functioning of the site. 
Moderators will be based on the number of posts on the forum and will be selected on interviews to ensure insults as well as the benevolence of users. 
The relationship between the site and the partners will be managed through a communication team. 
Here’s how I see my future startup.

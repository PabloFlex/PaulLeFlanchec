Skills needed :  1+ years of experience in web development technologies; have in-depth knowledge of PHP and OOP<br>

Developper Druppal Back end. It’s my passion because I love managing all server transmitions as well as client database. I’m passionate about data and computer programming in backend. 
The job consists in developing sites with the cms Drupal and Laravel. The advantage of cms is that the client can modify the content of the page himself. I know Drupal well but not Laravel. I know how to code in php and I have a good knowledge of CMS in general. I think that I will deepen my knowledge in Laravel to be the most versatile.   Making a website in its entirety with Laravel seems to me the easiest way to learn and understand how this CMS works.

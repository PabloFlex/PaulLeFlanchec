                <p>Holding the sticks in an efficient manner is key to getting off to a good start. An easy way to find your grip is to stand up with your hands at your side. 
                  Using your left hand, place the stick into your right hand. The flat part of your thumb should make contact with the stick and your remaining fingers then wrap around naturally.
                   Repeat the procedure, placing the other stick into your left hand. Grip the sticks back slightly from the actual balance point (the middle) of the stick. When using matched grip,
                    it’s common that the butt (back) of the stick makes contact near the bottom of the inside of your hand.</p>

                <p>Heel-down vs. Heel-up In heel-down technique, the entire bottom portion of the foot remains on the pedalboard as the lower leg and ankle push down. This technique allows for the beater to bounce easily off the head, producing a more resonant bass drum tone. In heel-up technique, your heel rises slightly off the pedalboard, while the ball of the foot remains. With heel-up, it’s easier to bury the beater (allow it to remain on the head), giving off more attack and less resonance. This technique uses the bigger muscles in your upper leg and hip and can yield extremely powerful strokes.
                    Using heel-down, beginners often have trouble keeping their toes from coming off the pedal; and using heel-up, they often lift their entire foot off the pedal and stomp on it. Lifting off the bass drum pedal provides no mechanical advantage and can produce long-term control issues</p>

                <p>Songs Let’s face it; drumming is mostly used for accompaniment. Our job is to help convey the message and support the song. Though there are many great play-alongs available, drumming to music that includes both vocal melody and lyrics is invaluable. Ex. 6a–6d Listed here are four basic rock grooves with a song recommendation for each. Obviously, many more beats (and songs) could be added to this list. Some of the tempos are a little too fast for some beginners. Slow-downer programs, available as apps or software for your PC, are highly recommended to help with this issue.</p>

                <p>Ostinatos Drum set coordination can be a frightening prospect to beginners. One way to develop coordination is to use ostinatos (continuous patterns). The idea is to get one or more of your limbs going repeatedly so you won’t have to think about that limb as much. In turn, your other limbs can begin to perform functions independently. Ex. 9 Instead of the typical ostinato workouts in which the feet maintain a steady pattern and the hands play over the top, here, the hands remain constant while the feet change things up.</p>

              <div class="timeline-body">
                <p>List For Beginners The following rudiments are relatively easy for beginners to grasp: single-stroke rolls, double-stroke rolls, single paradiddles, multiple bounce rolls, five-, six-, seven-, and nine-stroke rolls, flams (including power flams), flam accents, flams taps, and Swiss army triplets.

                    Application Once you are accustomed to these rudiments, apply them to the drum kit. Ex. 10 In this one-measure groove, a nine-stroke roll, seven-stroke roll, flam tap, and flam are applied to the hi-hat and snare.</p>

                <p>Alternating Most people pick up on the concept of alternating (one stick after another) very easily. Ex. 14a Hand-to-hand playing works very well here, especially when the right foot is not involved. However, when you take the kick drum into consideration, you see that both the right and left hands land on the beat (with the kick), and the involved coordination is more challenging.

                    Logical Approach The concept here is that the dominant hand lands on every beat. Because of this, sticking becomes much more predictable, and coordination with the kick is easier. Ex. 14b: Compare this sticking to the feeling of the alternating example (14a).</p>
